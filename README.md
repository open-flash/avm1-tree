AVM1 type definitions for Rust and Typescript (Node and browser).
Provides types to represent the static structure of Actionscript Virtual Machine 1 (AVM1) data.

- [Rust implementation](./rs/README.md)
- [Typescript implementation](./ts/README.md)

This library is part of the [Open Flash][ofl] project.

## Usage

- [Rust](./rs/README.md#usage)
- [Typescript](./ts/README.md#usage)

## Goal

The goal of this library is to provide a low-level abstract representation of
AVM1 structure. The code structure is the Control Flow Graph (CFG), a structure
representing the AVM1 actions and jumps between branches as a graph.

It also provides an even lower representation for raw actions using byte offsets
for the jumps.

## Status

This library is complete. It should be stable, but more real-life usage and
feedback is expected before releasing the version `1.0.0`.

The library is lacking documentation. It should be fixed before the release
`1.0.0`.

The library API should not change unless new undocumented actions are discovered
or issues in the API are found.

## Contributing

- [Rust](./rs/README.md#contributing)
- [Typescript](./ts/README.md#contributing)

You can also use the library and report any issues you encounter on the Github
